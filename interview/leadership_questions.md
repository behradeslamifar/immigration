Yes I do. In the last position at Cafebazaar , I was a team leader.
I have multiple leadership experience. Actually I have worked as a team leader for most of my career.

2. Why did you quit Cafebazaar?  
I resigned, because I wanted to prepare myself and my family for immigration.

3. How Many people did you lead?  
I have multiple leadership experiences. I have managed different teams from 2-3 people to 6 people. Once I even got the responsibility of two teams which in total was around 10 people, though after a few months I was able to hand over one of the teams, as it is obvious managing such a big team is not a good idea at all.

6. Do you like to be a hands-on person or a manager? Which one do you prefer better?  
I am an objective oriented person, so if I see I can be more useful as a manager I would take the opportunity to have a positive impact on my team and if I see I need to roll up my sleeves and to start developing, I wouldnâ€™t wait a second to do so.
